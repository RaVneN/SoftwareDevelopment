                    The Super Mario video game series is a series of platform video games created by Nintendo featuring their mascot,
                    Mario. Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series or simply the Mario series, it is the central series of
                    the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game
                    console and handheld.

                    The Super Mario games follow Mario's adventures in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, usually with Mario as the 
                    player character. He is occasionally joined by his brother, Luigi, and other members of the Mario cast. As in 
                    platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels. The games 
                    have simple plots, typically with Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. 
                    The first title in the series, the 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) release of Super Mario Bros., established 
                    gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every Super Mario game since, including a multitude of power-ups 
                    and items that give Mario special powers like fireball-throwing and size-changing into giant and miniature sizes.

                    series have been sold worldwide, making it the best-selling video game franchise.
